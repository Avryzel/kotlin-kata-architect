## ðŸ§  Architectural Discipline
In every solution, the primary focus is not just solving the challenge, but making a *deliberate technical decision*.

### Key Pillars of Architectural Quality:
1.  **Efficiency:** How fast should it be?
    * *Focus:* **Performance** (optimizing for time complexity $O()$).
2.  **Longevity (Sustainability):** How will it keep running?
    * *Focus:* **Readability** and **Maintainability** (using clean Kotlin idioms).
3.  **Reliability & Safety:** How will it recover after failure?
    * *Focus:* **Reliability/Resiliency** and **Security** (ensuring predictable, safe behavior).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Solutions are organized by their difficulty rank (Kyu), ensuring a clear path of progression:

- `/8-kyu/`: Beginner Logic & Basic Kotlin Idioms.
- ...and so on.
